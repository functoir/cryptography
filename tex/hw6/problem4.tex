\begin{problem}
Suppose that Alice and Bob have the same RSA modulus $n$ and suppose that their encryption exponents $e$ and $f$ are relatively prime.  Charles wants to send the message $a$ to Alice and Bob, so he encrypts to get $b=a^e \pmod{n}$ and $c=a^f \pmod{n}$.  Show how Eve can find $a$ if she intercepts $b$ and $c$.
\end{problem}

\begin{Answer}
  Since $e$ and $f$ are relatively prime,
  Eve can find $x, y$ such that $e \cdot x + f \cdot y \equiv 1 \pmod n$.

  \noindent
  Then:

  \begin{align*}
    b^x + c^y = a^{e \cdot x + f \cdot y} &\equiv a^{1} \pmod{n} \\
  \end{align*}

  \noindent
  Thus, if Eve Eve intercepts both $b$ and $c$,
  and finds the corresponding values for $x$ and $y$ such that $e \cdot x + f \cdot y \equiv 1 \pmod n$,
  she can recover $a$ as the equivalent of $b^x + c^y \pmod{n}$.
\end{Answer}
