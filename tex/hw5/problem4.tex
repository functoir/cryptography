\begin{problem}
Here you will prove something that was claimed in lecture!
\begin{enumerate}\renewcommand{\itemsep}{3mm}
\item Find all monic irreducible polynomials of degree $\leq 4$ in $\F_2[X]$.
\item Verify that the Rijndael polynomial 
\[ f(X)=X^8+X^4+X^3+X+1 \] is irreducible in $\F_2[X]$.  
\emph{[Hint: Any factor must have degree at most $4$.]}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
