\begin{problem}
In one of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries, Lord Peter is confronted with the following message:

\vspace{1ex}

\begin{verbatim}
I thought to see the fairies in the fields, but I saw only the evil
elephants with their black backs.  Woe! how that sight awed me!  The
elves danced all around and about while I heard voices calling clearly.
Ah! how I tried to see--throw off the ugly cloud--but no blind eye of a
mortal was permitted to spy them.  So then came minstrels, having gold
trumpets, harps and drums.  These played very loudly beside me,
breaking that spell.  So the dream vanished, whereat I thanked Heaven.  I
shed many tears before the thin moon rose up, frail and faint as a sickle of
straw.  Now though the Enchanter gnash his teeth vainly, yet shall he
return as the spring returns.  Oh, wretched man!  Hell gapes, Erebus now
lies open.  The mouths of Death wait on thy end.
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{1ex}

He also discovers the key to the message, which is a sequence of integers:
\[ 
\texttt{7876565434321123434565678788787656543432112343456567878878765654433211234}
\]

\begin{enumerate}\renewcommand{\itemsep}{3mm}
\item Decrypt the message. \emph{Hint. What is the largest integer value?}

\begin{Answer}
The largest integer value is $8$, and there are no $0$ values,
suggesting that the scheme runs from $1$ to $8$.
Using this strategy, I wrote a program that split the message
into 8 lists of letters.
Here is the resultant matrix:

}
\noindent
Using the key to pick out rows for each letter position,
I picked out the following letters:

{\color{crimson}
\begin{verbatim}
  hesittethbetweenthecherubimstheisles
  maybegladthereofastheriversinthesouth
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
When spaced out properly, the above reads:
{\color{crimson}
\begin{verbatim}
  He sitteth between the cherubims the isles
  may be glad thereof as the rivers in the south
\end{verbatim}
}

encryption scheme?
