\begin{problem}
For fun, take a stab at this problem.  In one of his cases, Sherlock Holmes was confronted with the following message:

\begin{center}
534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 7 21 41

DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE

26 BIRLSTONE 9 127 171
\end{center}
Although Watson was puzzled, Holmes was immediately able to deduce the type of cipher.  Can you?
