\hspace{2.5ex}Dear George,

Greetings to all at Oxford.  Many thanks for your

letter and for the Summer examination package.

All Entry Forms and Fees Forms should be ready

for final despatch to the syndicate by Friday

20th or at the very latest, I'm told, by the 21st.

Admin has improved here, though there's room

for improvement still; just give us all two or three

more years and we'll really show you!  Please

don't let these wretched 16+ proposals destroy

your basic O and A pattern.  Certainly this

sort of change, if implemented immediately,

would bring chaos.

\begin{Answer}
  
Since \textbf{all} it was unlikely that the message was encrypted
since every word in the message is correct.
I next looked at the words at corresponding positions in each sentence,
and discovered:


  \textcolor{red}{your package ready Friday 21st.\ room three. Please destroy this immediately.}
