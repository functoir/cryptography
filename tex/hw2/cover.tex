\CreditStatement{
  I worked on these problems alone,
  with reference to class notes and the following books:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{\textbf{The Code Book}} by \textbf {Simon Singh}.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Cryptography}} by \textbf {Simon Rubinsen-Salzedo}
  \end{enumerate}
  I also wrote some code to help in automating some of the problems.
  \newline
  Rather than upload all the source code,
  I tried to demonstrate the logic in my responses.
  \newline
  Please let me know if you would like to see the source-code.
